# Testing 
In our testing approach, we utilized input testing by generating a set of test cases consisting of various user inputs. The test cases were designed to ensure that the API behaves as expected in different scenarios, such as when an invalid ID is provided, no ID is provided, or when the correct data is returned. We also used Postman, a popular tool for testing APIs, to perform additional tests and verify the responses from the API. This testing methodology allowed us to ensure that our API was reliable, accurate, and met the requirements of the application.

# Bugs and Issues :
Our code has been thoroughly tested and we've not found any bugs. The API is functioning as intended, and providing the expected results for various user inputs. Additionally, the extensions we have implemented are working correctly.


# Bugs Resolved :
Our code encountered a 404 error which was difficult to resolve and took a significant amount of time and effort to fix. The error was caused by an unidentified issue in the code, requiring us to extensively debug and analyze the problem.


# Extensions :

1.
